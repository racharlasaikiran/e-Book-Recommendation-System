# e-Book-Recommendation-System
A machine learning–based Book Recommendation System built using Python. This project uses cosine similarity to recommend books based on user-selected input. It involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and building a similarity-based recommendation engine.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a recommendation system that suggests books similar to a selected book.
The model analyzes the features of each book and calculates similarity scores between them using sklearn’s cosine similarity.
